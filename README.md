# SPS-ml-tutorial

Home for the materials for the SPS machine learning and python programming tutotial I gave on Jan. 29th and 30th, 2020. Anybody can use/redistribute/repurpose these materials in any context they want (though attribution would be nice if you copy everything exactly!)

Workshop is formatted over 2 days of 1.5 hours each. The first day covers an introduction to google colab and jupyter, and then an in-depth description of data processing, visualization, and storage methods useful for machine learning. The second day covers the theoretical and motivational bases for ML, before giving a step-by-step walkthrough of building a neural network. 

There is also a small model zoo, but it is severly underpopulated and would benefit from additions from others :-)
